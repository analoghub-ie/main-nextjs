### 1. Differential signals testbench
Sometimes we need to create a differential signal testbench (i.e. for a differential amplifier). The following structure
generates differential signal with a given amplitude and frequency:

***V0*** source defines the offset of the signal (common-mode), and ***V1*** denotes the signal shape, amplitude and 
frequency. Voltage-controlled current sources ***E0*** and ***E1*** with the gains of -1 and 1 define the positive and 
the negative outputs, respectively. The results of the simulation of the following structure are shown below:
